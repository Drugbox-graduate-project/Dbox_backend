Our project is a service that assists in the management of various pharmaceuticals within households and helps properly dispose of expired medications.

We provide guidelines for managing the inventory and expiration dates of over-the-counter and prescription medicines, as well as instructions on how to dispose of waste pharmaceuticals according to prescribed methods.

By utilizing this service, we aim to address various issues caused by improper disposal methods and, ultimately, reduce unnecessary consumption of pharmaceuticals to promote the well-being and health of individuals and the environment.
